              <p class="">
                Vidyakunj Primary School, which is owned and run by Krisha Education & Charitable Trust â€“ Dolvan, has
                been working to
                mould young minds since 2014. Its only objective is to give kids a holistic education with integrated
                learning and to
                encourage their creativity.

                The school offers a unique learning experience, which is a blend of fun and academics. The focus is on
                overall
                development of the child, and not just on academics. This is done by encouraging creativity and hands-on
                learning.

        <p class="  ">Vidyakunj Primary School (VPS) was established with a vision to nurture responsible citizens of
          tomorrow through quality
          education and a learning environment that is student-friendly yet intellectually inspiring.

          The school goal is to provide education beyond the classroom and to turn their students into critical
          thinkers, problem
          solvers, lifelong learners and gratified individuals of a responsible society.</p>
        <p>
          The school has created a conducive environment for learning and development, where students are encouraged to
          express
          their thoughts and opinions freely. Learning is not confined to classrooms and the school focuses on
          extra-curricular
          activities and field trips to engage the students.</p>
        <p>
          The teachers and staff members at VPS take their roles seriously and guide the students with utmost care as
          they are the
          custodians of the future. They strive to instill the values of honesty, integrity, respect and empathy in
          their
          students.

        </p>
        <p>
          The school also has a robust system of monitoring and evaluation to ensure the personal growth of each
          student. The
          assessments and feedback system help the teachers and administrators to understand the strengths and
          weaknesses of the
          students and work towards their overall development.
